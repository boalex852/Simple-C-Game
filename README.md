# Simple-C-Game
A simple game created in C/C++.

In the game, we spawn clocks which show the current system time, and when we shoot them, they split into 2 smaller clocks. 
When all the clocks are destroyed, we respawn the initial two clocks.

To shoot use space, to rotate use the arrows on keyboard. To exit game, press escape.

Project built on Visual Studio 2022.
